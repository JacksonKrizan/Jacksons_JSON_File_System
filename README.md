This is a Template that I created to store simple data using a JSON file system.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

JSON files are used to store data. The advantage of using JSON files is that they're lightweight, human-readable, and, lastly, JSON is based on a language-independent data format.

The benefits of using JSON to save game data are, it's simple, quick to load, and it's easy to transfer between platforms.

The drawbacks or limitations of JSON are that it lacks type enforcement, supports no comments, and isn't ideal for large or secure data.

Some other alternatives may be

1. SQLite Database
Why use it: Structured queries, efficient, supports multiple tables.
Best for: Mobile games, RPGs, user data, and complex inventories.

2. XML
Why use it: Supports comments, schemas, and complex structures.
Best for: Structured data with validation or integration with older systems.

3. MySQL
Why use it: Powerful, scalable database with structured querying (SQL), ideal for managing large, relational datasets with high integrity.
Best for: Online multiplayer games, leaderboards, user accounts, game analytics, and any system requiring secure, persistent, and complex data storage.
